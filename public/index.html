                    <p>...and this is my website for CS4550/CS5610 at Northeastern University,
                        Summer 1, 2016. If you like what you see, check out the course website <a
                                href="http://portal-cs5610online.rhcloud.com/#/">here</a>.</p>
                    <p>By following the nav links at the top, you can see what I've developed
                        throughout the course of this class: The assignment was something I worked
                        on week by week along with guided tasks assigned by the professor. The
                        project is something I came up with and worked on independently, due at the
                        end of the semester. I've put a lot of work into it, hope ya like it!</p>
                    <p>Oh and, if you're interested, all of the source is <a
                            href="https://github.com/A-lxe/aubuchon-alex-web-dev">here</a>.</p>
                </div>
                <div ng-if="currentNavItem == 'project'">
                    <div layout="row" layout-align="center center">
                        <md-button class="md-raised md-accent" ng-href="/project/index.html">
                            Go to Arcus
                        </md-button>
                    </div>
                    <p>This is my project: Arcus! It's a website intended to categorize and display
                        each and every one of the <a href="https://discordapp.com">Discord</a> chat
                        bots on the planet. Arcus is still in its early stages of course, but it's
                        at a fantastic baseline for further refinement.</p>
                    <p>For the uninformed, Discord is a voice and chat client that's been taking the
                        gamer community by storm because it keeps doing right what every other major
                        chat/voice client has been doing wrong for the past decade. Along with its
                        uprisal, countless developers have designed their own chat bots that Discord
                        users can add to their servers. These bots have all kinds of features from
                        telling you the weather in a second, to playing music in your voice
                        channel.</p>
                    <p>Arcus allows developers to advertise their bots among its indices. They
                        control the description, information, etc, and Arcus handles the rest,
                        providing an easy "Add to Server" link, and grabbing profile images and data
                        off the discord API.</p>
                    <p>Arcus allows everyday discord users to browse all the bots it has to offer
                        through the "Go to Bots" page. This includes a search utility that can help
                        them meet their needs quicker. They can also expand the view for a
                        particular bot to see what others have commented on it. Likewise, they can
                        view a developers profile to see their bots, and what people think about
                        them in comments. If a user registers/logs in, either through the classic
                        username/password, or via Discord API authentication, they too can comment
                        on bots and developers, as well as manage their public profile.</p>
                    <h3>A few notes:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you see an empty circle where a profile image should be, that means
                            the user or the bot doesn't yet have one configured.
                        </li>
                        <li>The Add to Server button requires some specific information from the bot
                            application on discord, and if some of the values are provided, the link
                            won't work. This is on the developers to ensure.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>To the graders:</h3>
                    <p>If there's anything at all I can help with/correct/inform, please contact me!
                        Arcus has been a blast to design, and I want it to be the best it can
                        be.</p>

                        the professor's instruction. For Arcus to live happily on here, I had to
                        disable the server side for this, but don't let that stop you! (Though you
                        likely won't get far without server side authentication :))</p>
